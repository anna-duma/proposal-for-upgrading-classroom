# **Proposal for Upgrading Classroom EEB003**

## Introduction

Classroom equipment is often constructed to stand the test of time. When equipment causes pain for students, it can affect their ability to focus and participate in class. This proposal aims to encourage University of Washington to consider upgrading classroom desks to an ergonomic model to improve student comfort.


## Usage

This sample was created as part of a classroom assignment, but can be used as a proposal in a real-life scenario.

## Future Applications

This proposal can be updated to include the latest model of desk or to include other equipment improvments for the classroom.
